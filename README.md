# README template-2020

## Introduction

This repository is a basic template with which you can build your own website. You can consider it a boilerplate, or set of ready-coded files that you can customise for your own purposes. 

The underlying template design uses a website building framework known as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 4</a>. Learning Bootstrap is quite complicated, but you can learn about it at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/">W3Schools Boostrap 4 Tutorials</a>

The template provided here, though, implements Bootstrap within the conventions of GitHub Pages, and uses the file structures of GitHib Pages to ease the process of publishing your pages.

## How to use

Look closely at the files in this repository. 

You will see a number of files are named with the .md file extension. That is: **index.md**, **page2.md** â€¦ **page5.md**. 

### .md files explained

.md stands for MarkDown. You don't need to use the markdown language, and we don't introduce it here. But, there are many features and advantages of these .md files:

* .md files are automatically converted to HTML files when you publish them. This is done by the GitHub Pages Jekyll engine. 

* When you edit the .md files, you are only editing the content for the BODY part of your pages. The system will then automatically insert the content of your md files into the BODY section of your HTML of your pages, and Jekyll will publish them into fully formed HTML documents.

* You still need to use HTML tags in your .md files, but only the tags you use in the body of the document. E.G.: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>` etc..

* The big advantage of .md files is that editing these won't affect the architecture and structure of your main HTML template. However, it's important to be aware of renaming these files. 

### Other essential files

1. **HTML Template** : The HTML template file of your site is named **default.html** and is located in the **&#95;layouts** folder. You will only need to edit this slightly to name the labels of your navigation bar.  Apart from that, you won't need to edit the HTML template at all - unless, of course, you want to get into deeper levels of customisation.

1. **Stylesheet** : In the folder **assets/css**, you will find the **style.scss** file. .scss is a varient of css and works in the same way. You can edit this file to create custom styles for your site. For example, you will be able to change the colours of your banner, and make any other style adjustments you choose.

1. **images** : This is the directory to store your image files. Inside the images folder you can find a **readme.md** file explaining how to use this directory.

1. **Config file** : Finally, the **&#95;config.yml** file is a configuration file, where you modify the settings for your site. You also use this file to set the mappings for your pages to the navigation bar.
